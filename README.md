The SVG of the logo wouldn't load.  I tried to use the local version of the file, which didn't work, and the version on github had a URL that was a mile long.  I ended up using the github-hosted PNG version.

Also, some pages are bigger than others, and I'm not sure why.  I think that was happening a while ago, at some point.

Figure out why nodemailer won't work - probably will need help on this one.
